## Brief introduction to RPC

RPC, stands for remote procedure call, and it's a way of communicating
services.

#

## What is Avro?

Avro is an Interface Definition Language widely used in the data
engineering world.

#

## What is mu?

mu is an opensource library by your friendly folks @ 47Degrees.  It's
located in github and opensource, check it out https://github.com/higherkindness/mu-scala

## How does mu work?

mu provides the ability to combine RPC protocols, services, and clients in your Scala program, thanks to gRPC. Although it’s fully integrated with gRPC, there are some important differences when defining the protocols, as we’ll see later on.

#

## Defining the protocol

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "mu-server" % "@MU_VERSION@"
```

## Creating the server

## Creating the client

## Other IDLs

## Protobuf
